# qc_automatic_report
##Create an automatic report on quality control data, analysis and graphical output ready for human interpretation.  
###Problem
* Scientists should spend more time conducting experiments and less time repeating the same analyses with identical documentation.  
* Doing analyses in Excel with lots of manual intervention is prone to error: "Common errors are simple, simple errors are common". We need to automate these processes otherwise our quality control analyses may misfire due to a typo or datum in the wrong cell.

###The solution
This is an R Markdown document that will demonstrate the utility of this style of reactive documentation for quality control at your company.

###See example  
Download the **html** file and open it in your browser. This is the output of the **Rmd** script including summary graphics and the LC50 statistic.
